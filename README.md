# Problem Definition
## Project	1 – Vehicular	network:	car	sensing
A vehicular system is composed of N vehicles that move randomly within a 2D floorplan of size
𝐿 × 𝐻, according to a waypoint model. A waypoint is defined by a pair of coordinates (x,y) and a
speed s. The coordinates x, y are random variables to be defined later. Vehicles move between
waypoints a and b at the constant speed selected together with b. As soon as a vehicle reaches a
waypoint, it selects a new one and moves towards it.
Vehicles are equipped with a wireless interface and can communicate with other vehicles falling
within their transmission range M. Every T seconds each vehicle checks how many cars are within its
transmission range. The relationship between T and M is expressed as 𝑇 =∝× 𝑀! due to power
constraints. α is the efficiency of the wireless interface and can assume values between 0 and 1.
Evaluate at least the overall rate of vehicles sensed per second for various values of M and α.
At least the following scenario has to be evaluated:
• uniform distribution of x and y;
In all cases, it is up to the team to calibrate the scenarios so that meaningful results are obtained.
Project deliverables:
a) Documentation (according to the standards set during the lectures)
b) Simulator code
c) Presentation (up to 10 slides maximum)
